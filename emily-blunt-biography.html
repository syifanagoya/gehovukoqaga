Emily Blunt had a stuttering problem as a kid</strong></p><p>Emily had a problem with stuttering since she was 6 years old. She lived with the issue for another seven years. But, then, how does she speak so clearly, you may wonder. Here’s the reason why. Emily had a teacher who suggested participating in a school show in a different accent. And guess what, it worked! Emily is one of those few celebrities who openly talk about such problems. As she mentioned in one of the articles about her stuttering, “I was a smart kid and had a lot to say, but I couldn’t say it. It would just haunt me.
